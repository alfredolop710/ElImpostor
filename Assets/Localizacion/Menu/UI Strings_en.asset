    m_Localized: 'A game to play in real life with your friends or family.

      There
      are two roles: the local role and the impostor role.

      If you are the
      local, your goal is to discover who the impostor is.

      If you are the
      impostor, your goal is to hide well so you don''t get caught and try to guess
      the word.

      The way to play is to say a word that is related to the secret
      word, trying not to make it too obvious so that the impostor or impostors don''t
      guess what the word is.

      Depending on the number of players, you can
      play several rounds, in which the final card tells you who starts, and you
      continue clockwise. When each player in the round has said a word, everyone
      votes on who the impostor might be.'
